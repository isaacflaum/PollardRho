# PollardRho
This repository contains a Java and Javascript implementation of the PollardRho Factoring Algorithm. Algorithm can be run with any nodejs version that supports ES6 syntax as well as in the browser console. Just cd into the directory containing the pollardRho js file and run `node pollardRho.js`. Seed and Number to factor can be configured as well as the number of iterations or guesses to make.

The Java version uses BigInteger so that we are limited only by cpu and memory rather than by the length of a 64 bit integer. The results are pretty cool. For instance with some trial and error, I found that  `0320823808834580534803458035480354083540835083508380083508354803548023839589345823895345737945973532342344898384858324579385479834857825782785782789457982798587924578927894578924795729879857897895789279859782534832457835248787352897243879235489789787993427957283597832978459878051` is a prime number.
